# Tola

This is a pascal source code for a game, similar
to snake. Full source code  is available. Game is 
in text mode.

If you plan in fixing the code - just cosmetic pull requests. I will not maintian this game besides the historical value. 

You will need TP7 (or compatible compiler for DOS) in order to compile it.

Home page contains also a zip with the EXEs
